## Installation
**`IMPORTANT:` Make sure you have the Spotify app installed and that you are logged in or your test device!**

First, add `spotify_playback` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file. 

Afterwards, download the Spotify Android SDK [here](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/releases/tag/v0.6.1-appremote_v1.1.0-auth) and move the spotify-app-remote-release-x.x.x.aar file to `android/app/libs/` in your project.

Then initialize the spotify playback sdk like this 

```dart
@override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initConnector();
  }

  /// Initialize the spotify playback sdk, by calling spotifyConnect
  Future<void> initConnector() async {
    try {
      await SpotifyPlayback.spotifyConnect(clientId: "", redirectUrl: "").then(
          (connected) {
        if (!mounted) return;
        // If the method call is successful, update the state to reflect this change
        setState(() {
          _connectedToSpotify = connected;
        });
      }, onError: (error) {
        // If the method call trows an error, print the error to see what went wrong
        print(error);
      });
    } on PlatformException {
      print('Failed to connect.');
    }
  }
``` 

After this you can use all the available methods

## Function examples
### GetImage   
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/WARNING-23-orange.svg)](https://github.com/qreate/spotify-playback-flutter/issues/23)
Get image accepts the following parameters:
* URI, the spotify image uri - string
* Quality, the quality the image should be provided in - int 0-100
* Size, the spotify image size can be one of the following
  * ImageDimension.THUMBNAIL = 144px
  * ImageDimension.X_SMALL = 240px
  * ImageDimension.SMALL = 360px
  * ImageDimension.MEDIUM = 480px
  * ImageDimension.LARGE = 720px
```dart
//You can provide an image uri
SpotifyPlayback.getImage(uri: "spotify:image:3269971d34d3f17f16efc2dfa95e302cc961a36c", quality: 100, size: 360);

//Or you can provide an url returned webAPI
SpotifyPlayback.getImage(uri: SpotifyPlayback.imageLinkToURi("https://i.scdn.co/image/3269971d34d3f17f16efc2dfa95e302cc961a36c"), quality: 100, size:360);

//Theese both return a Uint8List encoded image.
//You can then use the Image.memory() to display the image
Image.memory(yourUint8ListImageHere)

```
